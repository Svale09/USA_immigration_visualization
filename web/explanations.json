In the immediate aftermath, there was a sharp decline in air travel as passengers feared for their safety and new stringent security measures were implemented. The industry faced a massive challenge as airlines had to adapt to new security protocols and regain public confidence. Although the recovery was slow, air travel eventually rebounded as enhanced security measures became the new norm and travelers began to feel safe again."

    "text": "Between 1996 and 2000, immigration into the United States via border crossings with Canada and Mexico experienced a significant rise. This period was marked by strong economic growth in the United States, which attracted many seeking better job opportunities and living conditions. The economic prosperity of the late 1990s, coupled with relatively stable political conditions in neighboring countries, facilitated a surge in cross-border migration. The ease of movement across these borders allowed for increased travel for work, family reunification, and other personal reasons."

    "text": "The turn of the millennium marked the beginning of a continuous decline in immigration through these border crossings, a trend that lasted until 2011. Several factors contributed to this drop. The aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led to heightened security measures and stricter immigration policies, making border crossings more challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, the economic downturn in the early 2000s, followed by the global financial crisis of 2008, reduced job availability and economic incentives for migrants. These factors combined to significantly reduce the flow of immigrants across the Canadian and Mexican borders during this period."

During these years, the number of crossings remained relatively stable, neither increasing nor decreasing significantly. This stagnation was partly due to a more stable economic environment in the United States post-recovery from the 2008 crisis, which provided a consistent, though not booming, demand for labor. Policy changes and enforcement also stabilized, creating a more predictable environment for those considering crossing the borders."

The introduction of travel restrictions, lockdowns, and stringent health protocols drastically reduced the movement of people across international borders. Both Canada and Mexico, along with the United States, implemented measures to curb the spread of the virus, which included limiting non-essential travel and temporarily closing borders. This resulted in a steep decline in immigration through these land crossings."

By 2023, the roll-out of vaccines and the gradual lifting of travel restrictions led to a resurgence in cross-border movement.

Additionally, some residual effects of the pandemic, such as changes in labor market demands and persistent health concerns, continue to influence migration patterns."
